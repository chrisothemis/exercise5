Created custom styles in the client folder and imported them into main.scss
Added code in main.js in order to highlight the clicked element in nav
o-gallery has been added to bower

Section 1 - contains text + parallax image similar to the FT website, parallax resized for mobile devices

Section 2 - has 3 tabs with lorem ipsum

Section 3 - image in a 2 column and text in a 10 column, with the image dissapearing on small devices (go Houdini!)

Gallery with css that sets a fixed height in order to prevent it from "bouncing" when images don't have the same height

Thank you for the opportunity to learn more through this project and for being accomodating with my holiday, I would've sent it on the 3rd but the javascript bit took a little longer and didn't want to take advantage of the whole extra time.
